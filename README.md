# Sinatra Refrigerator Inventory app

The refrigerator ("Fridge") inventory app provides a database and web interface for users to:
* Create an account which manages user's Fridges and Items contained within.
* Each user can **ONLY** modify content of his/her own fridge (and its contents within).  The **EXCEPTION** is with shared accounts.  A fridge rarely belongs to just one person, so multiple people can "co-own" a fridge with this app's built-in account ```linking``` feature.
    * A user can create, read, update, and delete (CRUD) any items in a fridge to which he or she is an owner or co-owner of said fridge.
    * A user is also able to perform CRUD operators on any fridges themselves to which he/she owns/co-owns.
    * A user, in addition to sharing fridges with other users, can also view the accounts to which he/she is currently sharing and use an ```unlinking``` feature to unlink any user that is currently linked.
    * A user is also able to update his/her own information, as well as update current password, and delete his/her account.
    * User inputs are validated for users, fridges, and items creation.

This app was built with Sinatra, extended with [Rake tasks](https://github.com/ruby/rake) for working with an SQL database using [ActiveRecord ORM](https://github.com/rails/rails/tree/master/activerecord).
